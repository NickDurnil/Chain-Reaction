                <p>Our 2022-2023 team (pictured above) was made 
                    up of a wide variety of dedicated individuals 
                    who put in countless hours to build an amazing machine.</p>
                <h2>Meet the Team</h2>
                <p>Are you involved with an elementary school class, 
                    club, scout troop, or similar organization who 
                    want to learn about what we do? We love talking 
                    to kids about Rube Goldberg, our team, and STEM!

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>In the spring of 1998, freshman engineer 
                    Shawn Jordan approached the Purdue Society 
                    of Professional Engineers with a proposal: 
                    starting a new Rube Goldberg team on Purdue's 
                    campus. With the help of then-president Karen 
                    Davis, a new group began designing and building 
                    a machine under the original name, PSPE Rube 
                    Goldberg Machine Team. The first machines 
                    were built with nearly no budget, meaning 
                    that cardboard, duct tape, and job fair 
                    give-a-ways were the primary components. 
                    The temporary nature of these materials made 
                    reliability a challenge for the dedicated 
                    group of individuals, whose creativity shined 
                    through in the machines they took to competition. 
                    Since then the competition has taken different 
                    forms, but when it moved back to its original 
                    home at Purdue in 2019, now called the Purdue 
                    National Chain Reaction Competition, the team 
                    revised their name to match.</p>
                <h2>Our Machine</h2>
                <p>Our 2021 machine is currently under construction!
                    Last year's machine (2020), followed an inventor 
                    as he travels on the Oregon Trail on his way to 
                    a fair to show off his newest invention - the 
                    doorbell. Unfortunately, because of COVID-19, 
                    we were not able to complete this machine, but 
                    you can still see our video of the partial machine.</p>
