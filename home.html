                    Were you wondering about the Boilermaker Chain Reaction Team? Well you've 
                    come to the right place! While Purdue has multiple Rube Goldberg Teams, our 
                    team is proud to have won the national title many times throughout its existence, 
                    the most recent of which coming just this last year. We've also appeared on Jimmy 
                    Kimmel Live back in 2014 and still hold the World Record for the longest Rube 
                    Goldberg machine set in 2012! If you want to learn more about us, stick around and Boiler up!

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>In the spring of 1998, the PSPE Chain Reaction Team  was founded by a 
                        freshman engineer named Shawn Jordan with the idea of creating a Rube 
                        Goldberg team for Purdue University. With the backing of then president, 
                        Karen Davis, the first team began work on their first ever machine. With 
                        almost no budget, the first machines created by the team were mostly 
                        constructed from low cost materials such as cardboard, duct tape, and 
                        various give-a-away items from different events around campus. Due to the 
                        low durability of these materials, creating a reliable machine was a challenge, 
                        but due to their dedication and creativity, the early groups still designed and 
                        built many various machines to bring to competition. Since the club's founding, 
                        this same competition has taken many different forms, until it moved back to its 
                        home on Purdue's Campus in 2019 taking the official name of the Purdue National 
                        Chain Reaction Competition . In reflection of this move the team changed its name 
                        to match. A few years later in 2022, the team split off from PSPE and became its own 
                        club now the Boilermaker Chain Reaction Team.</p>

                    <p>The 2022-2023 Team (shown above) was composed of a variety of talented and dedicated 
                        individuals who put in over three thousand hours to build an incredible machine. </p>

                    <h2>Our Machine</h2>
                    <p>The 2023 machine's construction is yet to begin, but our team is excitedly looking

                        was an epic casino heist! Follow the thief as he steals the casino's precious ruby and 
                        makes his escape before kicking off a final goal in honor of the World Cup! To see more of
